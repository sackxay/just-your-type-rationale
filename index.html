  <h1>Rationale</h1>
  <p>For this assignment I chose a lyric by a rapper named <i>Royce Da 5'9"</i>. The verse has been edited for content and now goes as follows:</p>
    <figure>I am the deadliest rapper, you claiming that you flow like water but really y'all just like Evian backwards.
    </figure>
    <cite>–– Royce Da 5'9"</cite>

    <p>I used the minor fourth type scale and applied many classes to change the text sizes. This was a large enough type scale to use as the golden ratio was way too large to use and minor third was too small for my liking. The 2 google fonts used were Abril Fatface and Montserrat, a serif and sans-serif, one very uniform and the other almost decorative with a lot of character. The text cases are more stylistic than grammatical, as I chose to keep the word <i>rapper</i> in lower case as the fonts lower case alphabet is done beautifully and has a lot of style.
    <p>The first colour scheme I kept plain, with just red text on a white background. The red was chosen to symbolize the word <i>deadliest</i> until they stretch the screen out to the medium screen length where they will find the background change to that of Cyan, representing water itself with a text colour of black. A lighter colour on the cyan would be too hard to read, so the darkness of the black works perfectly and varies enough from the first screen to justify using it.</p>
    <p>Finally, the word <i>naive</i> is repeated through media queries and also placed on different heights of the screen through the main.css file. The word changes both colours and background colour only on the row of the word itself. Giving the movement of the word more emphasis than just changing the entire screen colour.
